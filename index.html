      <h2 style="color: white;">-Ready for an AI revolution?</h2>
      
      <br>
      <p style="color: white;">Digital life is augmenting 
         human capacities and disrupting eons-old human 
         activities. Code-driven systems have spread to more 
         than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information and connectivity,
         offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.
         As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues
         to spread, will people be better off than they are today?
         Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers,
         business and policy leaders, researchers and activists answered 
         this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.
         The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human
         effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. 
         They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match
          or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as
           complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics
            and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation
         Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications 
         of AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and
         healthier lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad 
         public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in
          the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition.
         Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed
         concerns about the long-term impact of these new tools on the essential elements
          of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked 
          to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many
           shared deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions.
         Overall, and despite the downsides they fear, 63% of respondents in this 
         canvassing said they are hopeful that most individuals will be mostly 
         better off in 2030, and 37% said people will not be better off
